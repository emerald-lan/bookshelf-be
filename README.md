# Bookshelf Backend

This is the backend of the bookshelf project, which provides APIs and database management for a web app that allows users to browse and buy books online. We made this project as a way to learn more about e-commerce and to share our love for reading. üìö

## For contributors

Please create a new branch for your contribution. DO NOT upload code to the `main` branch directly.

üìå Naming branch:

There are 2 types of branches:

-   Feature: This type of branch is for creating a new feature, and the functions should be well described in your Pull Request. Pattern: `feature/name`

-   Fix: Use this type of branch to fix an issue or a set of issues. Pattern: `fix/name`

The branch name will use kebab case: lowercase words and separated by a dash (-). E.g.: feature/example-new-feature
